### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a recent graduate of UW's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Here you will find mostly Bootcamp projects, and new projects I am working on in my spare time. 

I am a creative problem solver, and love working on code with small teams of people. I am currently looking for work in the field, so please contact me if you are interested in taking on an attentive employee and fast learner. 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Springboot and will be posting those projects on here soon!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am also a musician and visual artist! I love using creative problem solving across all of my passions - including coding! 

Thanks for stopping by! âœ¨
