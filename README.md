### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a recent graduate of UW's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Here you will find mostly Bootcamp projects, and new projects I am working on in my spare time. 

I am currently doing a React and GraphQL deep dive, and hoping to use these skills soon in a professional environment. As I am currently looking for work in the field, please contact me if you are interested in taking on an attentive employee and fast learner. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am also a musician and visual artist! I love using creative problem solving across all of my passions - including coding! 

Thanks for stopping by! âœ¨
